<h1>Infants</h1>

Unlike other medications, biologics are antibodies. Just like the antibodies a mother
transfers naturally to her baby during pregnancy, biologics do cross the placenta and
enter the baby’s blood stream.

The biologic can start actively crossing the placenta from Week 20 in pregnancy
with the majority of the transfer occurring in the third trimester. As a result,
your baby may be born with the biologic detectable in their blood.

If exposed to a biologic in pregnancy, your infant cannot receive live vaccines
for the first 9 to 12 months of life. There is an increased risk of infection in
the first year of an infant’s life when anti-TNFs are used in combination with other
immunosuppressants (eg azathioprine). Safety data is otherwise reassuring for anti-TNF
use in pregnancy. However, it is important to note that there is only limited experience
with the newer biologics such as ustekinumab and vedolizumab.
