In some cases, if the bowel is too inflamed or diseased,
the surgeon may need to bring the bowel to the abdominal wall and create an opening
(ileostomy if small bowel; colostomy if large bowel) from which stool can be passed.
An ileostomy can be a diverting/loop ostomy which means the stoma is formed from a loop
of small bowel and the rest of the small bowel and colon may still present, but bypassed.
An end ostomy means the bowel is brought straight out to the skin to create the stoma.
