**Surgery: UC -J pouch (IPAA)**

Preconception note: A colectomy does not affect fertility.
However, removal of the rectum and creation of the J-pouch can reduce fertility
IF the fallopian tubes are damaged during surgery OR if adhesions (scar tissue)
forms after the surgery. Unfortunately, often there is no way to predict this will happen.
Therefore, if you require this surgery or have had this surgery,
please discuss with your surgeon and gynecologist/obstetrician regarding your
plans to become pregnant.
