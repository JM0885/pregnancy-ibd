<h1>Fertility</h1>

Fertility is generally not affected by IBD, excluding if your IBD is active or if you have had certain surgeries in the past.
Women who have inactive IBD are as likely to become pregnant as women who do not have IBD. Women who have active IBD may find it more difficult to become pregnant. Therefore, it is recommended that you be in remission for at least 3 to 6 months prior to attempting to become pregnant.
