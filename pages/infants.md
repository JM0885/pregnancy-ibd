<h1>Infants</h1>

IBD medications generally are not known to adversely affect the baby in the future in terms of organ development including immune system development or risk of infection (with the exception of methotrexate). There may be an impact on which vaccinations your infant can receive in the first year of life (just like medications may impact which vaccinations you can receive)

**Biologics specific information:**

Unlike other medications, biologics are antibodies. Just like the antibodies a mother transfers naturally to her baby during pregnancy, biologics do cross the placenta and enter the baby’s blood stream.

The biologic can start actively crossing the placenta from Week 20 in pregnancy with the majority of the transfer occurring in the third trimester. As a result, your baby may be born with the biologic detectable in their blood.

**Vaccinations:**

The medications a mother takes during pregnancy may affect whether or not the baby can receive certain vaccinations. While we recommend that decisions regarding medication choices in pregnancy are made independently to the effects on infant vaccination safety, knowledge regarding safe vaccination practices is important.

If exposed to a biologic in pregnancy, your infant cannot receive live vaccines for the first 9 to 12 months of life. 

Further information regarding vaccination information relevant for your listed IBD medications are shown below.

**Infections:**

There may be an increased risk of infection in the first year of an infant’s life when anti-TNF biologics are used in combination with other immunosuppressant's (eg azathioprine). Safety data is otherwise reassuring for anti-TNF use in pregnancy. However, it is important to note that there is only limited experience with the newer biologics such as ustekinumab and vedolizumab.
