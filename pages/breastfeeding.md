<h1>Breastfeeding</h1>

Breastfeeding a baby will help support the health of your child today and in the future.
There is also evidence that babies who are fed onlyï¿¼ breastmilk for the first six months of
life will have a lower risk of developing ear infections, respiratory illnesses and diarrhoea.
They are also less likely to have lifelong conditions like allergies and asthma.
