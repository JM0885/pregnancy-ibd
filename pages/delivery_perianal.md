**Perianal disease**

Patients with active or complex perianal disease, including those who require surgeries for them, may benefit from avoiding vaginal delivery and having a C-section delivery. There is concern that vaginal delivery and complications from vaginal delivery may worsen the peri-anal disease, and that active peri-anal disease may lead to poor wound healing in the perineum.
