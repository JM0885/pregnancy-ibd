<h1>Medications (Pregnancy)</h1>

Like all medications, those used to treat IBD have different potential benefits,
risks and side effects. For most medications, the risk of your IBD becoming active (flaring)
and the risks associated with active IBD outweigh the potential risks and side effects of
taking the medications. The effect of IBD medications during conception, pregnancy and
breastfeeding varies according to the medication type.
