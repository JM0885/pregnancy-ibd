<h1>Disease Activity</h1>

**Active disease (or Flare)**: when an individual is experiencing symptoms of IBD because tissues are inflamed and irritated

**Inactive disease (or Remission)**: when symptoms are under control and there is minimal tissue inflammation

## **Will my IBD Affect Pregnancy or the Baby?**

Compared with the general population, women living with IBD may have a slightly increased risk of the complications listed below. These risks are increased if IBD is active during pregnancy

**Pre-term births** (before 37 weeks gestation) estimated to occur in:

* 5 of every 100 births (in women with **inactive IBD**) vs. 15 of every 100 births (in women with **active IBD**)<sup>1</sup>

Pre-term birth can be associated with difficulties with temperature regulation, feeding and breathing. Pre-term birth can also be associated with complications (including of the heart, eyes and bowel and infections), prolonged hospital stay and learning and development disabilities. <sup>1</sup>

**Low birth weight** (2500g or 5.5 lbs) estimated to occur in:

* 3 of every 100 births (in women with **inactive IBD**) vs. 10 of every 100 births (in women with **active IBD**)<sup>1</sup>

Low birth weight can be associated with cognitive and developmental disorders.<sup>1</sup>

**Loss of pregnancy** (miscarriage or spontaneous abortion) estimated to occur in:

* 10 of every 100 births (in women with **inactive IBD**) vs. 30 of every 100 births (in women with **active IBD**)<sup>2</sup>

**Congenital malformations** (conditions or defects that affect the baby from birth and usually throughout their life)
* There is not enough information available to determine whether or not  the risk of congenital malformations is higher or lower in women who have IBD 

## **Will Pregnancy Affect my IBD?**
Women who have active disease at the time of conception have a 2/3 chance of their disease staying active or flaring worse, and a 1/3 chance of going into remission.   

Women who are in remission at the time of conception have a 2/3 chance of staying in remission during pregnancy and a 1/3 chance of flaring.   

Women with ulcerative colitis may have a higher risk of flaring during pregnancy than women with Crohnâ€™s disease.   
In general, it is recommended to try to be in remission at the time of conception for better chances of staying well in pregnancy. 

## **Is my IBD Active or Not?**

There are several tests that can be done to determine if your disease is active (flaring) or inactive (in remission) before you get pregnant. 
Your doctor may recommend you have one of the following tests to determine if you are in truly in remission before you get pregnant: 
* Blood tests (note: CRP can increase in pregnancy; albumin and iron levels can decrease in pregnancy)
* F-Cal (fecal calprotectin) stool test can indicate if your disease is active or becoming active. It is a useful test to have checked before pregnancy and monitored during pregnancy. 
* Ultrasound of intestines 

* Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy
* CT or MRI

Be sure to advise the doctor or technician if you are trying to conceive or may be pregnant, as endoscopic or imaging tests may need to be delayed or modified
