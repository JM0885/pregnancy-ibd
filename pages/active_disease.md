<h1>Active Disease</h1>

**Active disease (or Flare)**: when an individual is experiencing symptoms of IBD because tissues are inflamed and irritated

**Remission**: when symptoms are under control and there is minimal tissue inflammation

**Will my IBD affect pregnancy or the baby?**

Compared with the general population, women living with IBD may have a slightly increased risk of the complications listed below. These risks are increased if IBD is active during pregnancy

Pre-term births (before 37 weeks gestation) estimated to occur in:

* 5 of every 100 births (in women with **inactive IBD**) vs. 15 of every 100 births (in women with **active IBD**)

Low birth weight (2500g or 5.5 lbs) estimated to occur in:

* 3 of every 100 births (in women with **inactive IBD**) vs. 10 of every 100 births (in women with **active IBD**)

Loss of pregnancy (miscarriage or spontaneous abortion) estimated to occur in:

* 10 of every 100 births (in women with **inactive IBD**) vs. 30 of every 100 births (in women with **active IBD**)

Congenital malformations (conditions or defects that affect the baby from birth and usually throughout their life)
* There is not enough information available to determine whether or not  the risk of congenital malformations is higher or lower in women who have IBD 

**Is my IBD active or not?**

There are several tests that can be done to determine if your disease is active (flaring) or inactive (in remission) before you get pregnant. 
Your doctor may recommend you have one of the following tests to determine if you are in truly in remission before you get pregnant: 
* Blood tests 
* F-Cal (fecal calprotectin) stool test can indicate if your disease is active or becoming active. It is a useful test to have checked before pregnancy and monitored during pregnancy. 
* Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy
* Ultrasound of intestines 
* CT or MRI
Be sure to advise the doctor or technician if you are trying to conceive or may be pregnant, as these tests may need to be delayed or modified
