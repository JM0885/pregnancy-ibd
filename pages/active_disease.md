<h1>Active Disease</h1>

Is my IBD active or not? Tests to determine disease activity in IBD.  
There are several tests that can be done to determine if your disease is active (flaring) or inactive (in remission) before you get pregnant. 
Your doctor may recommend you have one of the following to tests determine if you are in truly in remission before you get pregnant: 
Blood tests 
F-Cal (fecal calprotectin) stool test can indicate if your disease is active or becoming active. It is a useful test to have checked before pregnancy and monitored during pregnancy. 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy

Be sure to advise the doctor or technician if you are trying to conceive or may be pregnant, as these tests may need to be delayed or modified
